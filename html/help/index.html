        <p>This site does not have many links to help you navigate, you will need to move forward by changing the path in the URL.</p>
        <p>Once you solve a piece of the puzzle, you can type the answer in the URL path to continue your journey. Sometimes you can also type keywords related to the puzzle to find additional clues (they are not needed to solve the puzzle, but may help you along the way).</p>
        <p>You can use spaces and uppercase letters in the path. In some cases you MUST use the proper capitalization, so try a few variations.</p>
        <p>Also, this site works best on a computer. Some of its secrets are hard to find using a mobile browser.</p>
        <p>If you are really stuck, click <a href="/help/I%20am%20stuck">I am stuck</a> for a hint.</p>

        <p>When trying a path in the URL, try it in multiple spots. For example, you may find it in the folder where you are or in the root of the site. Sometimes you can even find it in more than one place (wink).</p>
        <p>There are many ways to get stuck, but there are also many ways to get unstuck.</p>
